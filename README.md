# React Surf Weasel

### Description: 

<ul>
  Surf Weasel was originally an idea I had for a project in the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp. I decided to remake it into a more visually pleasing react-application.
</ul>
<ul>
  react-surf-weasel helps surfers find the best conditions for waves using the surfline API. 
</ul>
<ul>  
  Currently react-surf-weasel only works on local machines, as deployed applications get a *CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'* from surfline's API security (they don't use api keys). I am trying to resolve this problem with surfline in the meantime.  
</ul> 
<ul>
  In future developement, I would like to remake this into a mobile application where the API can be utilized from a local device, instead of using a deployed application.   
</ul>
<ul>
  At this time react-surf-weasel is still in developement. 
</ul>
