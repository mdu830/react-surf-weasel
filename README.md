# React Surf Weasel

### Description: 

<ul>
  <a href="https://github.com/sr70079/surf-weasel">Surf Weasel</a> was originally an idea I had for a project in the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp. I decided to remake it into a more visually pleasing react-application.
</ul>
<ul>
  react-surf-weasel helps surfers find the best conditions for waves using the surfline API. 
</ul>
<ul>  
  Currently react-surf-weasel only works on local machines, as deployed applications get a *CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'* from surfline's API security (they don't use api keys). I am trying to resolve this problem with surfline. In the meantime i have found another <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/marinesurfing-weather-rest-api">API</a> I plan to implement into a deployed application soon. 
</ul> 

#### future developement: 
<ul>
  I'm remaking surf weasel into mobile applications for android and ios. Later I may give users the option to use surflines API, but at present the new API I have   found seems to be more accurate than surflines forecasts. 
</ul>
<ul>
  I plan to setup my own HD beach camera API for users live stream beach conditions; to get a more accurate visual than what surflines cameras have to offer (starting off for carteret county NC and the surrounding areas)
  
</ul>
<ul>
  At this time react-surf-weasel is still in developement. 
</ul>
